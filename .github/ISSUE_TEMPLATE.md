### Guidelines

Delete this section in your issue...

This issue list is to report bugs or enhancements for the openHAB ZigBee binding. If you're not sure about something, please consider discussing it on the [forum](http://community.openhab.org) before raising an issue - more people follow the forum than monitor the issues list, so if you are having trouble with a device, or want to ask a question, you will have a much larger audience there.

Please provide a debug log file. You can enable debug logging with the following Karaf commands -:

```
log:set debug org.openhab.binding.zigbee
log:set debug com.zsmartsystems.zigbee
```
