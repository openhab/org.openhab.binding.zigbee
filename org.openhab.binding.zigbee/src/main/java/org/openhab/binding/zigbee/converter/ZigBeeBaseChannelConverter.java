/**
 * ZigBeeBaseChannelConverter class. Base class for all converters that convert between ZigBee clusters, attributes and
 * commands, and ESH channels.
 * <p>
 * The following converter lifecycle is defined -:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The thing handler may call {@link #getChannel(ThingUID, ZigBeeEndpoint)} to check if the device supports a
 * channel from the converter. The converter should check the features of the {@link ZigBeeEndpoint} to see if the
 * required features are available. If so, it should return the channel. This method allows dynamic channel detection
 * for unknown devices and may not be called if a device is defined through another mechanism.
 * <li>The thing handler will call the
 * {@link #initialize(ZigBeeThingHandler, Channel, ZigBeeCoordinatorHandler, IeeeAddress, int)} to initialise the
 * channel
 * converter. This simply links the converter to the node endpoint.
 * <li>The thing handler will call {@link #initializeDevice()} to initialise the device. This method may not be called
 * every time the converter is created, and may only be called when the device is first installed on the network, or
 * when the device needs to be reconfigured. It should configure the binding by calling {@link ZclCluster#bind()} and
 * configure reporting for attributes that are required to maintain state, along with any other one time device/channel
 * specific configuration that may be required.
 * <li>The thing handler will call {@link #initializeConverter()} to initialise the converter. The converter should get
 * any clusters via the {@link ZigBeeCoordinatorHandler#getEndpoint(IeeeAddress, int)} and
 * {@link ZigBeeEndpoint#getInputCluster(int)} or {@link ZigBeeEndpoint#getOutputCluster(int)}. It should configure any
 * listeners for Attribute changes or incoming commands. During the initialisation, the converter should populate
 * {@link #configOptions} with any configuration options that the device supports that may need to be adjusted by the
 * user.
 * <li>If the converter receives information from the ZigBee library that updates the channel state, it should update
 * the state by calling {@link #updateChannelState(State)}.
 * <li>The thing handler may call {@link #updateConfiguration(Configuration)} with an updated channel configuration from
 * the user. The handler should update the configuration in the device, read back the updated configuration if
 * necessary, and return an updated channel configuration to the thing handler.
 * <li>The thing handler may call {@link #handleCommand(Command)} if there is an incoming command.
 * <li>The thing handler may call {@link #handleRefresh()} to poll for an update of the channel data.
 * <li>The thing handler will call {@link #disposeConverter()} when the channel is no longer required. The converter
 * must release all resources an unregister any listeners from the ZigBee library.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Since many interactions with ZigBee devices can take an appreciable time to complete (especially for battery
 * devices, most of the above commands are run in separate threads. The thread management is handled in the
 * {@link ThingHandler} to allow common thread pools to be used so the converter does not need to be concerned with this
 * other than to be careful about thread synchronisation. A converter should not assume it has exclusive access to a
 * cluster as related functions may also be utilising the cluster.
