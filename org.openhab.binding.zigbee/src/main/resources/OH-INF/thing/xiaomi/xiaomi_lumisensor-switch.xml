	<!-- These devices do not correctly report their clusters, so they need a static thing definition for the binding to inject the correct clusters into the ZigBeeNode
		They will detect as a generic zigbee:device quickly on scan but remain unusable in that state 
		because they will not have gotten endpoint/channel/cluster linkaages.  

		This thing description takes effect when the modelId is detected as lumi.sensor_switch.  
		At that time sufficient details have been passed thru the binding to allow you to stop 
		the pairing attempts when coupled with this static channel definition.

		To pair just keep pairing and pressing the link button until the device detects as lumi:sensor_switch 
		instead of as a generic zigbee:device.  Then add the device in openhab and wait a bit for it to come online.  -->
